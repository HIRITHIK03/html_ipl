<center><h1>Chennai Super Kings &#128155</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>4-time IPL champion Chennai Super Kings had a torrid season last year, finishing 9th in the 10-team format and will be looking to right the wrongs with captain MS Dhoni at the helm this year. Dhoni, who had handed over the CSK captaincy to Ravindra Jadeja in 2022, had to take back the mantle mid-season when the team wasn’t getting the required results. This time on, Dhoni will be spearheading the squad from the very beginning in what might be his final IPL season. In the mini auction, Chennai acquired the services of all-rounder Ben Stokes for a whopping Rs 16.25 crores but there’s a huge question mark over his availability. According to reports, the England Test captain may have to be released from the squad in the latter stages of the tournament to prepare for the Ashes.

<p>CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan, however, said that he is confident that Stokes will be there with the team for the entirety of the IPL. Stokes also suffered a knee injury in the recent Test series against New Zealand but will fly in and join the squad ahead of the tournament. Chennai have a well settled team with the core mostly remaining the same after the 2023 auction. They have the talents of Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad opening the batting, followed by Stokes, Moeen Ali, Ambati Rayadu, MS Dhoni, Shivam Dube and Ravindra Jadeja. Their main strength, however, will be the presence of Stokes and Jadeja in the team as quality all rounders who are devastating with the bat and have a knack of picking up important wickets with the ball. They also have Mitchell Santner in their ranks which will enable them to bat pretty deep. Deepak Chahar leads the pace battery alongside Mukesh Chowdhury and Stokes while the spin department has Ali, Jadeja and Sri Lanka's Maheesh Theekshana. CSK had also bought New Zealand’s Kyle Jamieson in the mini auction last year for 1 crore but a back injury has ruled him out for the season. Chennai is one of the most decorated teams in IPL history and anything less than a title this season or any season is considered a disappointment. The team is filled with world class talents and if this is indeed Dhoni’s final season, the squad will ensure that they put all their might behind the common goal so that the legend can ride off into the sunset with a final trophy.</p>
